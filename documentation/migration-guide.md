# Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate your ReadMe CLI (`rdme`) setup to the latest version and prepare for future versions. Choose your migration path based on whether you're using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored).

1. If your project is using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored), [use `rdme@v10`](#migrating-to-rdme10) and beyond.
2. If your project is **not** yet using ReadMe Refactored, [use `rdme@v9`](#migrating-to-rdme9). The `v9` channel will continue to be maintained while we focus on making sure that everybody can upgrade their ReadMe projects to ReadMe Refactored.

## Migrating to `rdme@10`

### Overview

A [bi-directional syncing](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync) workflow with [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored) mostly eliminates the need for a tool like `rdme`. For syncing Markdown files, syncing API definitions, and managing project hierarchy (e.g., project versions and categories) with ReadMe Refactored, you'll want to set up bi-directional syncing.

`rdme@10` is recommended for the following use cases:

- Syncing your API definition (generated via a build process and not tracked via Git) to your ReadMe Refactored-enabled project
- Syncing Markdown files to the Changelog for your ReadMe Refactored-enabled project

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> `rdme@10` only works with ReadMe projects that are using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored). If you are not yet using ReadMe Refactored, [you'll want to use `rdme@9`](#migrating-to-rdme9).
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Upgrading to `v10`

#### Step 1: Upgrade via `npm`

To install this version of the `rdme` CLI globally, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g rdme@10
```

More installation options can be found in [our docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v10?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

#### Step 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

If you're using the `rdme` GitHub Action, update your GitHub Actions workflow file so your `rdme` usage uses the `v10` reference like so:

```yaml
- uses: readmeio/rdme@v10
  with:
    rdme: openapi validate petstore.json
```

#### Step 3: Address `v10` Breaking Changes

1. **Enable Bi-Directional Syncing** _(recommended)_

   We recommend setting up [bi-directional syncing](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync) for managing your Markdown files, API definitions and project hierarchy.

2. **Command Replacements**

   - Replace: `docs` (and its `guides` alias) → `docs upload` (see more in step 3 below)
   - Replace: `openapi` → `openapi upload` (see more in step 4 below)
   - Replace: `categories` → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Replace: `custompages` → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Replace: `versions` → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Remove: `open`

3. **`docs` has been replaced by `docs upload`**

   If you previously uploaded Markdown files to your Guides section via `rdme docs`, the command is now `rdme docs upload`. The command semantics are largely the same, but with a few small changes:

   - The `--dryRun` flag has been deprecated in favor of `--dry-run`.

   - There is no prompt to select your ReadMe project version if you omit the `--version` flag. It now defaults to `stable` (i.e., your main ReadMe project version).

   - `rdme docs upload` will now automatically validate your frontmatter and flag any issues prior to syncing. This is particularly helpful if you're coming from `rdme@9` or earlier, since the shape of certain frontmatter attributes (e.g., `category`, `parent`) have slightly changed. If you run this command in a non-CI environment, any outdated frontmatter will be detected and you'll have the ability to update it automatically.

   Read more in [the `docs upload` command docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v10/documentation/commands/docs.md#rdme-docs-upload-path) and in [the ReadMe API migration guide](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/api-migration-guide).

4. **`openapi` has been replaced by `openapi upload`**

   If you previously uploaded API definitions to ReadMe via `rdme openapi`, the command is now `rdme openapi upload`. There are now two main updates:

   - Like `docs upload` above, there is no prompt to select your ReadMe project version if you omit the `--version` flag. It now defaults to `stable` (i.e., your main ReadMe project version).

   - The flag paradigms have been simplified based on community feedback. Previously with `openapi`, the `--id` flag was an ObjectId that required an initial upload to ReadMe, which made it difficult to upsert API definitions and manage many at scale (and workarounds were added after the fact in the form of the `--create` and `--update` flags). With `openapi upload`, the `--id` flag has been renamed to `--slug` and is now optional. The slug (i.e., the unique identifier for your API definition resource in ReadMe) is inferred from the file path or URL to your API definition.

   Read more in [the `openapi upload` command docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v10/documentation/commands/openapi.md#rdme-openapi-upload-spec) and in [the ReadMe API migration guide](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/api-migration-guide).

## Migrating to `rdme@9`

### Overview

This release adds a few features that make it even easier to get started with `rdme`:

1. **Enhanced Command Documentation**

   - Complete command reference in [the `documentation/commands` directory](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands)
   - Detailed usage examples and parameter descriptions
   - Structured by command category for intuitive navigation

2. **Improved CLI Experience**

   - Overhauled help screens with detailed examples to improve readability and ease of use
   - Set up CLI autocompletions with [the `autocomplete` command](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/autocomplete.md)
   - Smart command discovery that helps catch and correct typos
   - Redesigned error messages with clear resolution steps

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> `rdme@9` only works with ReadMe projects that are **not** using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored). If you are using ReadMe Refactored, [you'll want to use `rdme@10`](#migrating-to-rdme10).
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Upgrading to `v9`

#### Step 1: Upgrade via `npm`

To install this version of the `rdme` CLI globally, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g rdme@9
```

More installation options can be found in [our docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

#### Step 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

If you're using the `rdme` GitHub Action, update your GitHub Actions workflow file so your `rdme` usage uses the `v9` reference like so:

```yaml
- uses: readmeio/rdme@v9
  with:
    rdme: openapi validate petstore.json
```

#### Step 3: Address `v9` Breaking Changes

1. **Verify your runtime**

   - For CLI users, make sure your Node.js version is up-to-date. The minimum required Node.js version for `rdme@9` is **v20.10.0**.
   - The `rdme` release process is no longer publishing Docker images and the GitHub Action is now a JavaScript action. This change should not affect any GitHub Actions users.

2. **Topic separator changes**

   - The topic separator (i.e., what separates a command from its subcommand) has changed from a colon to a space by default. For example, `rdme openapi:validate` is now `rdme openapi validate`.
   - The colon topic separator will continue to be supported so there is no need to change any existing commands, but all documentation and help screens will reflect the space topic separator.

3. **Command replacements**

   - Replace `swagger` → [`openapi`](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/openapi.md#rdme-openapi-spec)
   - Replace `validate` → [`openapi validate`](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/openapi.md#rdme-openapi-validate-spec)
   - Remove: `docs:edit`, `oas`

4. **Version flag updates**

   The CLI flags on [the `versions create` and `versions update` commands](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/versions.md) now maintain parity with [our API flags](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/createversion). The `--isPublic` flag has been removed in favor of a new flag called `--hidden`, which is the inverse of `--isPublic`.

   **Before**

   ```bash
   rdme versions:create 1.0.1 --isPublic true
   ```

   **After**

   ```bash
   rdme versions create 1.0.1 --hidden false
   ```

5. **Deprecated commands**

   The following commands (and their subcommands, if applicable) will be removed in `rdme@10`:

   - `categories`
   - `custompages`
   - `docs:prune` (and its `guides:prune` alias)
   - `versions`
   - `open`

   The following commands will be replaced in `v10`. See "Command Replacements" in [the `v10` migration guide above](#migrating-to-rdme10) for more info:

   - `docs` (and its `guides` alias) → `docs upload`
   - `openapi` → `openapi upload`

6. **Verify any scripts that utilize raw CLI outputs**

   - The underlying architecture for the CLI has been rewritten with [`oclif`](https://oclif.io/), so some command outputs and error messages may look different.
   - With the exception of the `--raw` flag on `openapi`, we recommend relying on CLI exit codes in your workflows rather than raw command outputs.

## Migrating to `rdme@8`

Please see [the `rdme@8.0.0` release notes](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/releases/tag/8.0.0).

\*If you uploaded an API definition prior to migrating your project to ReadMe Refactored, any existing workflows for syncing these files that use a legacy `rdme` version (i.e., `v9` or earlier) should continue to work, even after migrating. **For new workflows, we recommend following this migration guide and upgrading to the latest version.**
