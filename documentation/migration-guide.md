# Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate your ReadMe CLI (`rdme`) setup to the latest version and prepare for future versions. Choose your migration path based on whether you're using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/migration).

1. If your project is using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/migration), [use `rdme@v10`](#migrating-to-rdme10) and beyond.
2. If your project is **not** yet using ReadMe Refactored, [use `rdme@v9`](#migrating-to-rdme9). The `v9` channel will continue to be maintained while we focus on making sure that everybody can upgrade their ReadMe projects to ReadMe Refactored.

## Migrating to `rdme@9`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> If you have **not** yet migrated ReadMe Refactored, you'll want to use this version, `v9`! The `v9` migration guide can be found [here](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/blob/v10/documentation/migration-guide.md#migrating-to-rdme9).

\*If you uploaded an API definition prior to migrating your project to ReadMe Refactored, any existing workflows for syncing these files that use a legacy `rdme` version (i.e., `v9` or earlier) should continue to work, even after migrating. **For new workflows, we recommend following this migration guide and upgrading to the latest version.**
