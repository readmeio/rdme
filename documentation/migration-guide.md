# Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate your ReadMe CLI (`rdme`) setup to the latest version and prepare for future versions. Choose your migration path based on whether you're using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored).

1. If your project is using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored), [use `rdme@v10`](#migrating-to-rdme10) and beyond.
2. If your project is **not** yet using ReadMe Refactored, [use `rdme@v9`](#migrating-to-rdme9). The `v9` channel will continue to be maintained while we focus on making sure that everybody can upgrade their ReadMe projects to ReadMe Refactored.

## Migrating to `rdme@10`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> `rdme@10` has not been released yet. If you're using ReadMe Refactored, stay tuned!
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Overview

A [bi-directional syncing](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync) workflow with [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored) mostly eliminates the need for a tool like `rdme`. For syncing Markdown files, syncing API definitions, and managing project hierarchy (e.g., project versions and categories) with ReadMe Refactored, you'll want to set up bi-directional syncing. For more complex OpenAPI generation workflows, `rdme@10` can sync your API definition to your ReadMe Refactored-enabled project.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> `rdme@10` only works with ReadMe projects that are using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored). If you are not yet using ReadMe Refactored, [you'll want to use `rdme@9`](#migrating-to-rdme9).
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Upgrading to `v10`

#### Step 1: Upgrade via `npm`

To install this version of the `rdme` CLI globally, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g rdme@10
```

More installation options can be found in [our docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v10?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

#### Step 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

If you're using the `rdme` GitHub Action, update your GitHub Actions workflow file so your `rdme` usage uses the `v10` reference like so:

```yaml
- uses: readmeio/rdme@v10
  with:
    rdme: openapi:validate petstore.json
```

#### Step 3: Address Breaking Changes

1. **Enable Bi-Directional Syncing** _(recommended)_

   We recommend setting up [bi-directional syncing](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync) for managing your Markdown files, API definitions and project hierarchy.

1. **Command Replacements**

   - Replace: `categories` → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Replace: `custompages` → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Replace: `docs` (and its `guides` alias) → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Replace: `versions` → use [Git-based workflow](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)
   - Remove: `open`

## Migrating to `rdme@9`

### Overview

This release adds a few features that make it even easier to get started with `rdme`:

1. **Enhanced Command Documentation**

   - Complete command reference in [the `documentation/commands` directory](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands)
   - Detailed usage examples and parameter descriptions
   - Structured by command category for intuitive navigation

2. **Improved CLI Experience**
   - Overhauled help screens with detailed examples to improve readability and ease of use
   - Set up CLI autocompletions with [the `autocomplete` command](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/autocomplete.md)
   - Smart command discovery that helps catch and correct typos
   - Redesigned error messages with clear resolution steps

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> `rdme@9` only works with ReadMe projects that are **not** using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored). If you are using ReadMe Refactored, [you'll want to use `rdme@10`](#migrating-to-rdme10).
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Upgrading to `v9`

#### Step 1: Upgrade via `npm`

To install this version of the `rdme` CLI globally, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g rdme@9
```

More installation options can be found in [our docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

#### Step 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

If you're using the `rdme` GitHub Action, update your GitHub Actions workflow file so your `rdme` usage uses the `v9` reference like so:

```yaml
- uses: readmeio/rdme@v9
  with:
    rdme: openapi:validate petstore.json
```

#### Step 3: Address Breaking Changes

1. **Verify your runtime**

   - For CLI users, make sure your Node.js version is up-to-date. The minimum required Node.js version for `rdme@9` is **v20.10.0**.
   - The `rdme` release process is no longer publishing Docker images and the GitHub Action is now a JavaScript action. This change should not affect any GitHub Actions users.

2. **Command Replacements**

   - Replace `swagger` → `openapi`
   - Replace `validate` → `openapi:validate`
   - Remove: `docs:edit`, `oas`

3. **Version Flag Updates**

   The CLI flags on the `versions:create` and `versions:update` commands now maintain parity with [our API flags](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/createversion). The `--isPublic` flag has been removed in favor of a new flag called `--hidden`, which is the inverse of `--isPublic`.

   **Before**

   ```bash
   rdme versions:create 1.0.1 --isPublic true
   ```

   **After**

   ```bash
   rdme versions:create 1.0.1 --hidden false
   ```

4. **Deprecated Commands**

   The following commands (and their subcommands) will be removed in future releases:

   - `categories`
   - `changelogs`
   - `custompages`
   - `docs` (and its `guides` alias)
   - `versions`
   - `open`

5. **Verify any scripts that utilize raw CLI outputs**

   - The underlying architecture for the CLI has been rewritten with [`oclif`](https://oclif.io/), so some command outputs and error messages may look different.
   - With the exception of the `--raw` flag on `rdme openapi`, we recommend relying on CLI exit codes in your workflows rather than raw command outputs.

## Migrating to `rdme@8`

Please see [the `rdme@8.0.0` release notes](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/releases/tag/8.0.0).
