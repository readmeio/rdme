# Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate your ReadMe CLI (`rdme`) setup to the latest version and prepare for future versions. Choose your migration path based on whether you're using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored).

1. If your project is using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored), [use `rdme@v10`](#migrating-to-rdme10) and beyond.
2. If your project is **not** yet using ReadMe Refactored, [use `rdme@v9`](#migrating-to-rdme9). The `v9` channel will continue to be maintained while we focus on making sure that everybody can upgrade their ReadMe projects to ReadMe Refactored.

## Migrating to `rdme@10`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!WARNING]
> `rdme@10` has not been released yet, so this section is still under construction.

> [Please verify that you're looking at the latest docs for v9](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/migration-guide.md). If you're using ReadMe Refactored, stay tuned!

## Migrating to `rdme@9`

### Overview

This release adds a few features that make it even easier to get started with `rdme`:

1. **Enhanced Command Documentation**

   - Complete command reference in [the `documentation/commands` directory](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands)
   - Detailed usage examples and parameter descriptions
   - Structured by command category for intuitive navigation

2. **Improved CLI Experience**

   - Overhauled help screens with detailed examples to improve readability and ease of use
   - Set up CLI autocompletions with [the `autocomplete` command](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/autocomplete.md)
   - Smart command discovery that helps catch and correct typos
   - Redesigned error messages with clear resolution steps

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> `rdme@9` only works with ReadMe projects that are **not** using [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/welcome-to-readme-refactored). If you are using ReadMe Refactored, [you'll want to use `rdme@10`](#migrating-to-rdme10).

### Upgrading to `v9`

#### Step 1: Upgrade via `npm`

To install this version of the `rdme` CLI globally, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g rdme@9
```

More installation options can be found in [our docs](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

#### Step 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

If you're using the `rdme` GitHub Action, update your GitHub Actions workflow file so your `rdme` usage uses the `v9` reference like so:

```yaml
- uses: readmeio/rdme@v9
  with:
    rdme: openapi validate petstore.json
```

#### Step 3: Address `v9` Breaking Changes

1. **Verify your runtime**

   - For CLI users, make sure your Node.js version is up-to-date. The minimum required Node.js version for `rdme@9` is **v20.10.0**.
   - The `rdme` release process is no longer publishing Docker images and the GitHub Action is now a JavaScript action. This change should not affect any GitHub Actions users.

2. **Topic separator changes**

   - The topic separator (i.e., what separates a command from its subcommand) has changed from a colon to a space by default. For example, `rdme openapi:validate` is now `rdme openapi validate`.
   - The colon topic separator will continue to be supported so there is no need to change any existing commands, but all documentation and help screens will reflect the space topic separator.

3. **Command replacements**

   - Replace `swagger` → [`openapi`](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/openapi.md#rdme-openapi-spec)
   - Replace `validate` → [`openapi validate`](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/openapi.md#rdme-openapi-validate-spec)
   - Remove: `docs:edit`, `oas`

4. **Version flag updates**

   The CLI flags on [the `versions create` and `versions update` commands](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v9/documentation/commands/versions.md) now maintain parity with [our API flags](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/createversion). The `--isPublic` flag has been removed in favor of a new flag called `--hidden`, which is the inverse of `--isPublic`.

   **Before**

   ```bash
   rdme versions:create 1.0.1 --isPublic true
   ```

   **After**

   ```bash
   rdme versions create 1.0.1 --hidden false
   ```

5. **Deprecated commands**

   The following commands (and their subcommands) will be removed in `rdme@10`:

   - `categories`
   - `changelogs`
   - `custompages`
   - `docs` (and its `guides` alias)
   - `versions`
   - `open`

   The `openapi` command is deprecated and will be replaced in `rdme@10` by a command with a simpler flag setup based on community feedback.

6. **Verify any scripts that utilize raw CLI outputs**

   - The underlying architecture for the CLI has been rewritten with [`oclif`](https://oclif.io/), so some command outputs and error messages may look different.
   - With the exception of the `--raw` flag on `openapi`, we recommend relying on CLI exit codes in your workflows rather than raw command outputs.

## Migrating to `rdme@8`

Please see [the `rdme@8.0.0` release notes](https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/releases/tag/8.0.0).
