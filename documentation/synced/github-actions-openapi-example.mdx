Hello curious raw Markdown reader! ðŸ‘‹
This Markdown page is syncing to ReadMe via the `rdme` GitHub Action ðŸ¦‰
Peep the resulting page in our docs: https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/github-actions-openapi-example

We also do some fancy little find-and-replace action to swap out every instance
of `RDME_VERSION` below with the latest version of rdme.
Check out `.github/workflows/docs.yml` for more info on this!

Is your OpenAPI definition stored on GitHub? With [the `rdme` GitHub Action](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/rdme), you can sync it to ReadMe every time it's updated in GitHub. Let's go over how to set this up!

## Constructing a GitHub Actions Workflow

In order to construct the workflow file, you'll first want to obtain a unique API definition slug from ReadMe so we know which definition you want to update on subsequent re-syncs. You can obtain this API definition slug in one of several ways, but we'll dive into two below: uploading a file directly to your API Reference section in ReadMe and using the `rdme` CLI locally.

<details>
<summary>Uploading a file</summary>

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/openapi) on uploading a new OpenAPI file in "edit" mode in your project's API Reference section. Once the file is uploaded, you'll see the following in the API Definitions list (the red outline is where you'll find your API definition slug):

</details>
<details>
<summary>Using the <code>rdme</code> CLI</summary>

Alternatively, you can obtain the API definition slug by running the following `rdme` CLI command on your local machine:

```sh
rdme openapi upload [url-or-local-path-to-file]
```

Once you follow the prompts and upload your OpenAPI definition, you'll receive a confirmation message that looks something like this:

```
ðŸš€ Your API definition ([your-slug-here.json]) was successfully created in ReadMe!
```

</details>

Once you've obtained your API definition slug (let's call it `API_DEFINITION_SLUG`), your full GitHub Workflow file will look something like this:

```yml
name: Sync OpenAPI definition to ReadMe

# Run workflow for every push to the `main` branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout this repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Run GitHub Action to sync OpenAPI file at ./path-to-file.json
      - name: GitHub Action
        # We recommend specifying a fixed version, i.e. @RDME_VERSION
        # Docs: https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-versioned-actions
        uses: readmeio/rdme@RDME_VERSION
        with:
          rdme: openapi ./path-to-file.json --key=${{ secrets.README_API_KEY }} --slug=API_DEFINITION_SLUG
```

In the example above, every push to the `main` branch will sync the OpenAPI file located at `./path-to-file.json` to the API specification `API_DEFINITION_SLUG` in your ReadMe project.

> ðŸ“˜ Keeping `rdme` up-to-date
>
> Note that `@RDME_VERSION` (used in the above example) is the latest version of `rdme`. We recommend [configuring Dependabot to keep your actions up-to-date](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot).
