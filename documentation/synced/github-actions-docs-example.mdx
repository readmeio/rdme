Hello curious raw Markdown reader! ðŸ‘‹
This Markdown page is syncing to ReadMe via the `rdme` GitHub Action ðŸ¦‰
Check out the full example below,
and peep the resulting page in our docs: https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/github-actions-docs-example

We also do some fancy little find-and-replace action to swap out every instance
of `RDME_VERSION` below with the latest version of rdme.
Check out `.github/workflows/docs.yml` for more info on this!

> ðŸš§ ReadMe Refactored Guidance

> This guidance is only applicable for projects that have been migrated to [ReadMe Refactored](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/migration). The Refactored project architecture requires `rdme@10`, while the legacy project architecture requires `rdme@9`.

Do you have Markdown files stored on GitHub? With [the `rdme` GitHub Action](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/rdme), you can sync them to ReadMe every time they're updated in GitHub. Let's go over how to set this up!

## Constructing a GitHub Actions Workflow

In order to construct the workflow file, you'll first want to grab a project version or branch to ensure that your docs sync to the right place in your developer hub. That version or branch will be passed via the `--branch` flag. See below for a full example:

```yml
name: Sync `documentation` directory to ReadMe

# Run workflow for every push to the `main` branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout this repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Run GitHub Action to sync docs in `documentation` directory
      - name: GitHub Action
        # We recommend specifying a fixed version, i.e. @RDME_VERSION
        # Docs: https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-versioned-actions
        uses: readmeio/rdme@RDME_VERSION
        with:
          rdme: docs upload ./documentation --key=${{ secrets.README_API_KEY }} --branch=2.0
```

In the example above, every push to the `main` branch will sync the Markdown contents of the `documentation` directory to version 2.0 of your ReadMe project.

> ðŸ“˜ Keeping `rdme` up-to-date
>
> Note that `@RDME_VERSION` (used in the above example) is the latest version of `rdme`. We recommend [configuring Dependabot to keep your actions up-to-date](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot).
