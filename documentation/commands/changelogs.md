ARGUMENTS

FLAGS

DESCRIPTION
  Upload Markdown files to your ReadMe project as Changelog posts.

  Syncs Markdown files to the Changelog section of your ReadMe project. The path can either be a directory or a single
  Markdown file. The Markdown files will require YAML frontmatter with certain ReadMe documentation attributes. Check
  out our docs for more info on setting up your frontmatter: https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/rdme#markdown-file-setup

EXAMPLES
  Passing in a path to a directory will also upload any Markdown files that are located in subdirectories. The path
  input can also be individual Markdown files:

    $ rdme changelogs [path] --version={project-version}

  This command also has a dry run mode, which can be useful for initial setup and debugging. You can read more about
  dry run mode in our docs: https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/rdme#dry-run-mode

    $ rdme changelogs [path] --version={project-version} --dryRun

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  --key=<value>  ReadMe project API key

    An API key for your ReadMe project. Note that API authentication is required despite being omitted from the example
    usage. See our docs for more information: https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v10#authentication
