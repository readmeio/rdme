## `rdme docs upload PATH`

Upload Markdown files to the Guides section of your ReadMe project.

```
USAGE
  $ rdme docs upload PATH --key <value> [--github] [--dry-run] [--version <value>]

ARGUMENTS
  PATH  Path to a local Markdown file or folder of Markdown files.

FLAGS
  --dry-run          Runs the command without creating nor updating any Guides in ReadMe. Useful for debugging.
  --github           Create a new GitHub Actions workflow for this command.
  --key=<value>      (required) ReadMe project API key
  --version=<value>  [default: stable] ReadMe project version

DESCRIPTION
  Upload Markdown files to the Guides section of your ReadMe project.

  The path can either be a directory or a single Markdown file. The Markdown files will require YAML frontmatter with
  certain ReadMe documentation attributes. Check out our docs for more info on setting up your frontmatter:
  https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/rdme#markdown-file-setup

EXAMPLES
  The path input can be a directory. This will also upload any Markdown files that are located in subdirectories:

    $ rdme docs upload documentation/ --version={project-version}

  The path input can also be individual Markdown files:

    $ rdme docs upload documentation/about.md --version={project-version}

  You can omit the `--version` flag to default to the `stable` version of your project:

    $ rdme docs upload [path]

  This command also has a dry run mode, which can be useful for initial setup and debugging. You can read more about
  dry run mode in our docs: https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/rdme#dry-run-mode

    $ rdme docs upload [path] --dry-run

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  --key=<value>  ReadMe project API key

    An API key for your ReadMe project. Note that API authentication is required despite being omitted from the example
    usage. See our docs for more information: https://github.com/readmeio/rdme/tree/v10#authentication

  --version=<value>  ReadMe project version

    Defaults to `stable` (i.e., your main project version).
```
