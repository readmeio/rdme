Your GitHub Actions workflow file has been created! ✨

Almost done! Just a couple more steps:
1. Push your newly created file (.github/workflows/rdme-changelogs.yml) to GitHub 🚀
2. Create a GitHub secret called README_API_KEY and populate the value with your ReadMe API key (••••••••••••I_KEY) 🔑

🔐 Check out GitHub's docs for more info on creating encrypted secrets (https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
