## 6.5.0 (2022-03-01)

With this release, we are officially shipping first-class support for GitHub Actions within `rdme` ðŸš€ this means you can use the power of `rdme` to sync your OpenAPI definitions and Markdown files to ReadMe any time you make changes on GitHub.

Alongside this change, this release includes major documentation updates and support for relative external references when syncing OpenAPI definitions (thanks [@jdecool](https://github.com/jdecool))!
