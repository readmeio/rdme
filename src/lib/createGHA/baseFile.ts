/**
 * The base GitHub Actions workflow file, which is used for generating the YAML file.
 *
 * The reason this is expressed as a JavaScript string as opposed to a YAML file is because
 * TypeScript doesn't have a great way to copy over non-TS files to the `dist/`.
 * Plus, this way we can write internal comments like this!
