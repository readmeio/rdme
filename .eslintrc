     * This is a small rule to prevent us from using console.log() statements in our commands.
     *
     * We've had troubles in the past where our test coverage required us to use Jest mocks for
     * console.log() calls, hurting our ability to write resilient tests and easily debug issues.
     *
     * We should be returning Promise-wrapped values in our main command functions
     * so we can write robust tests and take advantage of `bin/rdme`,
     * which we use for printing function outputs and returning correct exit codes.
