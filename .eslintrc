     * console.log() calls, hurting our ability to write resilient tests and easily debug issues.

     * We should be returning Promise-wrapped values in our main command functions
     * so we can write robust tests and take advantage of `bin/rdme`,
     * which we use for printing function outputs and returning correct exit codes.
     *
     * Furthermore, we should also be using our custom loggers (see src/lib/logger.js)
     * instead of using console.info() or console.warn() statements.
